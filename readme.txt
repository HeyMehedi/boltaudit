BoltAudit helps you identify bloated, unused, abandoned, and performance-heavy plugins—plus database bloat, autoloaded options, and runtime impact.

== Description ==

BoltAudit gives you a clear, actionable overview of what’s slowing down your WordPress site.  
It inspects:  
- Active plugins and their actual impact on performance  
- Unused, abandoned, or rarely-used plugins  
- Heavy scripts, enqueued styles, database queries, and metadata  
- Autoloaded options, transients, and custom DB tables  
- Post details page with orphaned metadata and orphaned post records
- Server environment and PHP configuration  

Whether you're a developer, site owner, or agency, BoltAudit gives you visibility into bottlenecks with zero guesswork.

== Features ==

- Detect unused, outdated, or abandoned plugins  
- Full Plugin Audit section: inactive, outdated, abandoned detection  
- Plugin-level metrics: action/filter hook counts, cron job schedules, database query counts  
- Breaks down post types, metadata, revisions, and orphaned types  
- Analyzes option tables, autoloaded data, transients, and more  
- Database snapshot with table sizes, row counts, autoload bloat
- Server environment checks: PHP, MySQL, memory limits, upload size
- Lightweight, on-demand diagnostics—no front-end performance impact
- Responsive, accessible UI with performance optimizations
- WooCommerce Overview with product counts and performance insights (HPOS, cart fragments, and more)
